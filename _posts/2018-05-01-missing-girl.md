“How did you survive?” The reporter asked. </br>
The girl looked confused. She was now sitting on the hospital bed. </br>
“I…ate whatever I found…” she said. </br>
“You mean like plants? Animals?” reporter asked. </br>
“Animals.” She said. </br>
“Animals? What kind of animals dear? Small ones? Did any of them try hurting you?” reporter asked again. </br>
“No…they were nice to me.” She said. </br>
“Nice?” reporter asked. </br>
“Yes, they came towards me, mostly bunnies…they sat down next to me…they said I could eat them, it’s okay.” She said. </br>
The reporter smiled in confusion. </br>
“Sweetie, you were missing for 3 months, you must have seen or heard things that weren’t there, a group of people found you in the pipelines yesterday morning, passed out.” Reporter told the girl. 
“Passed out?” she asked. </br>
“Yes dear, you were unwell, you weren’t in your normal state, all dirty, some scratch marks here and there, are you sure nothing tried to harm you?” reporter asked again. </br>
“Yes…I told you, they told me I could eat them…they looked at me and talked to me…” she said. </br>
The Reporter looked at his partner and shook her head. She turned around and faced the girl to ask more questions. “Look sweetie, animals don’t talk okay? How else did you survive? Where did you find water?” </br>
“There was a small pond nearby, I managed to drink water from there…” she replied. </br>
“Well…after all these months we’re glad you’re fine.” Reported calmed the girl. </br>
“One more thing, how did you manage to hunt the animals? Didn’t you get hurt? Medical reports shows you’re fine.” She asked. </br>
“I…maybe because I didn’t kill them…” she said. </br>
“How did you manage to get your hands on them then?” reporter asked. </br>
“I told you…they saw me, they came close and told me that I could eat them, they looked at me and they knew I was hungry and they said its okay and I could eat them…” She said. </br>
The reporter shook her head. She wasn’t falling for it. </br>
“Im not lying, even Max said I could eat him that day, and Max never lies.” She added. </br>
“Max? Who’s max…?” reporter asked. </br>
“Max was my cat.” She said. </br>
The reporters frowned. She turned and asked her partner “What the fuck?” Her partner looked as confused and nervous as her. </br>
“Did you call the girl’s parents?” She asked her partner. </br>
“Yeah…they’re not picking up…” He said. </br>
“What…” She frowned. </br>
“I don’t think mommy and daddy want me back…” the girl said. </br>
“Sweetie you shouldn’t say things like that…” the reporter told the girl. </br>
“Its true.” She replied. </br>
“And why do you say that dear?” the reporter asked. </br>
“Because they told me they’ll come back to get me one day after leaving me there in that forest, but they never came back...” she replied. </br>
The reporter looked back at her partner and exchanged a fearful look. “I think we should just go…” he said to her. </br>
“Yeah…” she replied. </br>
“Sweetie we’re gonna go okay? Your parents will come soon and you can go home okay?” the reporter told the girl. </br>
She smiled. “Okay.”</br>
