“We shouldn’t be here too long…” Boy 1 said.<br>
“Just a bit more…” Boy 2 said. <br>
They both circled the haunting deserted house. Their sneakers rattled on the swarm of dried leaves around them. <br>
“Was your idea.” Boy 1 said. <br>
Boy 2 smiled. <br>
“What?” Boy 1 said. <br>
“The door is open.” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Let’s go” He added. <br>
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Do you seriously believe that kids go missing here? It’s all nonsense.” Boy 2 said as he walked into the half open house. <br>
“I do…I do believe…” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Well you’re just an idiot then.” Boy 2 said as he glanced around the room. “Who even used to live here?” Boy 2 said. <br>
“A military officer, this used to be a shack…he died out here…” Boy 1 said. “So people think his ghost is here? Taking away children who step foot on his territory?” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Yeah, that’s what they say…” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Nonsense.” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Aren’t you scared?” Boy 1 asked. <br>
Boy 2 circled around the rooms and blew off the high amount of dust on a painting. <br>
“What? Scared? Me? Nope.” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Not even a bit?” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Scared of what? A local legend?” Boy 2 replied. <br>
“Well I think it’s a bad idea to be here anyways.” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Hmm.” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Let’s just keep looking, we might find something useful.” Boy 2 added. “That’s crazy. What do you expect to find here?” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Has to be something. I mean the guy was in the military right? Maybe a gun or something? I can keep as a souvenir or something.” Boy 2 said. <br>
“Look, dusk is approaching, we should leave.” Boy 1 said. <br>
“Just a bit more…” Boy 2 said as he walked into the upcoming rooms. <br>
“The amount of dust here…damn…”Boy 2 said. He spotted something on the wall. “Hey, check this out. It’s like a marble or something, maybe we can take it?” Boy 2 said. <br>
There was no reply. <br>
“Hey?” Boy 2 frowned. He twitched and searched around for Boy 1. He was nervous. Very nervous. He frantically moved around searching for Boy 1. He checked the rooms once more before walking outside. Dusk had approached already. Fear now started building up in his heart. He walked towards the back of the house to find Boy 1 standing there with a pipe in his hand. “Hey…let’s…let’s go back…” Boy 2 said. <br>
Boy 1 walked fast towards Boy 2 and slammed the pipe against his head. Boy 2 fell to the floor twitching his body. Blood oozing out of his head. Boy 1 threw away the pipe and grabbed Boy 2’s arms and dragged his body further into the woods. <br>
