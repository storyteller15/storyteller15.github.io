<b>1. Charlie & Benny</b>
<br>
“We have to go back!” Benny let out. <br>
Charlie didn’t pay any attention. He kept his looks on the road ahead. His hands gripped tightly on the steering. <br>
“Are you listening to me..? I said we have to turn back!” Benny said again. <br>
“Look. I’m not turning back. What happened is in the past. No way am I turning back. Besides, the cops might have found her already.” Charlie said. <br>
“I don’t think so…look around you, it’s a fucking wasteland…nobody will find her at any time soon…and what if she’s still alive?” Benny asked. <br>
Charlie stayed quiet.<br>
“What if she’s still alive Charlie?” Benny let out.<br>
“I don’t know okay? I don’t know…all I’m saying is that I’m not going back for her…I can’t risk it. Jail? Court? No way man…no fucking way…” Charlie exclaimed.<br>
“You didn’t do it on purpose, it was an accident Charlie, we have to go back and help her…we have to!” Benny let out. The tires screeched to a halt as the car stopped. Dust faded away like smoke, from the wheels. Charlie opened the door and got out. He took out a cig and lit it. Benny followed him outside.<br>
“Well…?” he asked Charlie.<br>
“I don’t know…” Charlie answered.<br>
“We’re already wasting time here, you know that right? Instead of fucking driving back by now…” Benny said.<br>
“Benny…we go back…and what if she’s dead? Then? And what if someone sees us then? We’re fucking screwed then man…fucking screwed…they will call the cops and we’re done! It might be a piece of shit but it’s still my old man’s car and if they take it away he’s gonna be so pissed…and moreover, we might be taken in custody man…I don’t wanna go to jail and shit…!” Charlie smoked out heavily.<br>
“No…man…something tells me she’s still alive…and fuck all that nonsense, it was an accident…ACCIDENT! She jumped into the road ahead and we hit her…but now we have a chance to go save her. And that’s what we should do…” Benny proclaimed.<br>
“Charlie…we’re wasting precious time…precious time man…let’s turn back…I’m sure it’s not that far back…” Benny said again, in a much calmer tone.<br>
“Okay…okay fine…get in the car…we’ll go back.” Charlie tossed his cig away as he opened the door and stepped inside. Benny followed.<br>
“Fuck you for making me do this Benny…” Charlie let out as he reversed the car.<br>

<b>2. Mark</b>
<br>
“I’m going to fucking kill him…that’s what I’m going to do…” Mark said on the phone.<br>
*Mark, think about this…this isn’t right…* <br>
“I don’t care man…I just don’t care anymore…I don’t care if he’s my boss anymore…he fucking slept with my wife man!”<br>
*Mark…listen to me…whatever you’re gonna do, don’t…please*<br>
“She doesn’t understand, and now him too…made me work those extra hours for this?” Mark exclaimed. <br>
*Mark…we can talk about this…* <br>
“No man…I won’t…I have my revolver…gonna blow his fucking head tonight!” Mark exclaimed. 
*Mark…please…* <br>
“Then I’ll use the kitchen knife to fucking slit his body into pieces…I don’t fuckin…” The car screeched to a halt as he saw something lying on the road ahead of him. <br>
“Jason, I’ll call you back…” Mark said as he hung up and stepped out of his car. He approached the figure and realized that it was a girl. In her 20s possibly. Blood covered her body. Her hands twitched. Mark breathed slowly. He had no idea he would run into an almost dead person in the middle of the road. He frowned. He was tensed. He didn’t know what to do. He raced back to his car and grabbed his phone. He dialled 911. <br>
*This is 911. What is your emergency?* <br>
“Okay listen…I was driving and I found a girl on the road. She’s badly hurt and there’s no one else on the road…” <br>
*Okay sir…did you collide with her?* <br>
“No…no… I did not… I found her lying on the road…someone else might have…” <br>
*okay sir…I want you to bring her to the nearest town possible so that we can help her…do you understand?* <br>
“Okay…okay…I will…but what If she dies…?” <br>
*Sir…you can’t be sure of that…what you can do now is to bring her to safety…and staying in touch with us…* <br>
Mark held the phone between his mouth and grabbed the girl by her hips into his arms. Blood printed onto his shirt as he slowly placed her in the back seat. The tyres screeched as the car loomed ahead. <br>
“How far is the next town…? I’m not from around here…just passing through…” 
*its close sir…how is she doing?* he twitched his head around back and looked at the girl. She choked out some blood. <br>
“It…doesn’t look too good…” <br>
*Sir…I want you to assure her that everything is going to be okay…all right?* <br>
“Okay…okay…” he looked at her. <br>
“Everything’s gonna be all right…we’re close to the nearest town. We’re gonna get you treated and you’ll be okay…all right?” the girl’s eyes blinked. It was like she understood him. She choked out some more blood. <br>
“She keeps on choking blood…what do I do?” <br>
*listen to me sir…all you can do is get to the nearest town as soon as possible…* <br>
“That doesn’t make me feel any better…” Mark stepped on it as the car fumed ahead in the night. <br>
“Okay…okay now what?” the town had come into view. <br>
*find the nearest clinic and take her there sir…* he looked around frantically. He glanced back at the girl. Her body was now slowly twitching. Blood covered her mouth and neck. The back seat was now engulfed by the red liquid. <br>
“Shit…she’s dying…” <br>
*Sir…please locate the clinic immediately…* <br>
“I know…I know…I’m trying dammit…” Mark furiously looked around everywhere. The town was dead. That’s when he saw the sign. The car came to a loud halt. <br>
*Need Help? Come To Shrewsbury. We Offer help at any time of the day…* <br>
“Wait…where is Shrewsbury?” <br>
*That’s near the City sir…* <br>
“What? Which means there’s nothing here…in this town…what kind of place is this? There is no one here. It’s fucking dead. What do I do now?” <br>
*Sir I want you to take her to Shrewsbury where we can help her…* <br>
“What? What the fuck do you mean? Shrewsbury is close to the city meaning it’s another 50 miles from here!” <br>
*Yes sir and we want you to take her there…* <br>
“No…she’s gonna die by then! She won’t make it…” <br>
*Then we can’t help you anymore sir.* Mark frowned. <br>
“What…What the fuck do you mean you can’t help me anymore…?” Mark screams as the call ends. He dials again. <br>
*we can’t help...* *we can’t help* *we can’t help* <br>
“What…what the fuck is wrong with you people…?” he gets out of the car and opens the back seat and checks on her. <br>
“Oh god…oh god…” she wasn’t breathing anymore. “Oh fuck…what did I get myself into..?” he looks around and sees a large garbage barrel. He wiped the sweat off his face and carried her towards it. He dumped the body into it. The corpse landed with a loud thud. He looked around and walked ahead towards his car when his phone went off. <br>
*What the fuck happened Mark..? Been trying to ring you…you didn’t do it did you..?* <br>
“No…Jason…something happened…I’ll tell you when I get there.”<br>

<b>3.  Charlie & Benny</b>
<br>
“See? What did I tell you…?” Charlie looked around frantically on the road. A patch of dried blood lay there. <br>
“But…where’s the body?” Benny asked. <br>
“I don’t know…I don’t fucking know…all I know is that coming back was a bad idea…they’re probably somewhere around here waiting to pounce on us…they probably knew we were coming back…” Charlie lit a cig. <br>
“Who…who’s waiting?” Benny asked. <br>
“Cops man…the cops…they know…” Charlie exclaimed. <br>
“Shut up Charlie…” Benny let out. “Let’s just look around…maybe she wasn’t dead and she crawled out of the road…” Benny said. <br>
“But she would probably be dead by now anyway man…why don’t you let this go away?” Charlie asked. <br>
“Listen…I don’t want an innocent girl to die cause of us…because we didn’t do anything to help her…” Benny said. <br>
“You said it yourself. It was an accident!” Charlie let out. He flicked his cig away. <br>“Listen…I’m just going to drive back…I don’t care about this shit anymore…if you’re coming with me then do it otherwise don’t.” Charlie walked furiously towards the car. <br>
“Charlie…Charlie wait!” Benny followed him. “Okay…okay we do it your way…but first we have to see if she’s here at least.” Benny said. <br>
“What? Are you fucking crazy man?” Charlie let out. <br>
“Look…all we do is look around the area and if we find her we could still save her…” Benny said. <br>
“I can’t Benny…its fucked up…someone’s gonna see us…” Charlie said. <br>
“Nothing’s going to happen…” Benny said. <br>
“Hey maybe someone already found her and she’s okay now?” Charlie asked. <br>
“We don’t know that man…that’s why I want to make sure…” Benny said. “Just listen to me will you? This is important. We are potentially saving someone. At least trying our very best.” Benny said. <br>
Charlie sighed. “Well…we have to hurry up then…” Charlie said. <br>
They both started searching at opposite sides of the road. “See anything?” Benny asked. 
“Dirt…and more dirt.” Charlie said. <br>
“Don’t joke about this Charlie!” Benny let out. <br>
“Look around you man! There’s no one! Fucking no one! And you still think she’s here? Someone already took care of her man. Someone must have found her already…” Charlie spoke out. <br>
Benny sighed. Charlie walked towards him. “Benny…we tried. Let it go. Get in the car. We’ll leave.” Charlie said in a low tone. <br>
“Yeah…guess you’re right. I hope she’s fine though…” Benny said. <br>
“She is. I’m sure.” Charlie assured as they walked back towards the car.<br>

<b>4. Sheriff Colton</b>
<br>
“I might need backup on the guy, 15 minutes tops” He spoke on his talkie. <br>
*You sure about this guy Colt?* <br>
“The hell do you mean if I’m sure? That thing he dumped in the trash was a body Jeff…a fucking dead body…!” <br>
*Well just stay put…how did you see it anyway?* <br>
“Just passing through the town when I see the guy carrying something towards the trash and dumping it. Checked it after he left and saw a girl covered in blood. Dead. Probably in her 20s.” <br>
*And is your leg all right? You knocked that one pretty bad right?* <br>
“Yeah…Got hurt when I was cleaning the basement earlier.” The cop car let out the siren and paced closer towards the car in front. <br>
*Sir…I want you to stop the vehicle…Sir…stop the vehicle please…* Colton easily approached the car and slowly overtook it and brought it to a halt ahead. <br>
*Sir please step out of the vehicle…* The car door opened and a man stepped out. <br>
*What’s your name Sir?* <br>
“Listen, I didn’t do anything wrong…okay?” he said. <br>
*Sir, calm down…what is your name?* <br>
“Mark…my name’s Mark” he said. <br>
Colton got out of the car and approached Mark. “What were you doing in that town, Mark?” <br>
“I was just passing by Officer…” Mark said as he came closer to Colton. <br>
“What’s that on your shirt Mark? Looks like blood.” Colton asked.<br>
“Yes…it is and I have a good reason…I can explain…” Mark stuttered. <br>
“Where did you find that girl Mark?” Colton asked. <br>
“Officer…I…” Mark tried to speak. ”I found her on the road. Lying down…accident I’m thinking…I took her to the nearest town but there was no one there and she was dead by then…” 
“Why did you dump the body in the trash, Mark?” Colton asked. <br>
“I didn’t know what to do…she was dead and I wasn’t going to keep her in my car…” Mark replied. <br>
“Mark, why didn’t you report this at the precinct…?” Colton asked. <br>
“I…there was no one there dammit…dead. It was dead. The town was dead…” Mark replied. <br>
“Sir…I want you to stay calm because I want you to come to the nearby town with us…we take you to the precinct and we ask a few questions and then you can leave…” Colton said calmly, looking at the sweaty and tensed Mark. <br>
“But…I already answered all your questions…” Mark pointed out. <br>
“Look sir, just stay calm…” Colton said. Colton walked back to his car and switched on his talkie. <br>
*Be there in 5 Colt* <br>
“Sir…I’m innocent…I didn’t do anything…” Mark pleaded. <br>
“I just want you to stay calm Mark.” Colton replied. Mark rubbed the sweat off his forehead. He breathed out slowly. <br>
“Mark just stay calm and we…” Colton froze when he turned back. Mark was pointing a revolver at him. <br>
“Mark…where did you get the revolver?” Colton tried to calm him down. “Let’s take things slowly and put that away now shall we?” Colton added. <br>
“Look…I didn’t do anything wrong…tried to help someone but she died and it’s not my fucking fault!” Mark gripped his hands tighter on the trigger. A siren could be hard nearby. <br>
“Look…you’re gonna have to let me go from here officer…I can’t let your friends get here…I don’t want to be taken in…” Mark stuttered. <br>
“Mark, put the gun away and we’ll talk this through…” Colton slowly edged his fingers towards his buckle at his gun. <br>
“No! I don’t wanna talk…just let me go…okay?” Mark said. <br>
The other cop car could now be seen in view. Mark twitched his neck and got closer towards his door. <br>
“I’m going to get in and drive away, that’s what I’m going to do…so let me…okay?” Mark pleaded, still pointing the gun at Colton. <br>
“I’m afraid I can’t let you do that Mark…” Colton quickly drew his gun and fired at Mark. The bullet pierced through his throat. Mark twitched before firing his revolver back at Colton which shot through his knee. “Fuck…Fuck…”Colton limped towards Mark and grabbed the revolver from him. Mark lay on the floor choking out blood. <br>
“Sorry, Mark…I tried to work with you…but you thought otherwise…” Colton said as he looked at Mark breathing for a few final times. A second cop car pulled up behind Colton. <br>
“Jesus…Colt you okay?” an officer opened the door and leaped out. <br>
“Yeah…bastard shot me in the leg but I’m okay…tried to talk with him but got outta hand…had to put him down.” Colton replied. “He said he’s innocent…I don’t believe that. Check the car, might find something useful.” He added. <br>
“Fuck. All sorts of shit here…kitchen knives, ammo for the revolver…” the other officer said to Colton. <br>
“Fucker…can’t even imagine what he was doing with that girl…” the officer added. 
“Yeah…neither can I…” Colton said.<br>

<b>5. Becky & Mandy</b>
<br>
“Well…now what?” Becky asked. <br>
“Car’s fucked Becky, I don’t know what to do.” Mandy replied. <br>
“It was your idea to take this trash…you should know how to fix it.” Becky said. 
“Becky…I don’t want to hear you whine anymore…okay?” Mandy said. <br>
“Oh for fucks sake, now I’m whining…look around you Mandy, it’s the fucking middle of nowhere and its almost night. What do you expect me to do…?” Becky let out. <br>
“I don’t know” Mandy said. <br>
“Oh fuck you Mandy; I’m getting in the next car that shows up. Probably there’s a garage somewhere nearby.” Becky said. <br>
“We haven’t seen anyone for a long time. You expect to see someone now…?” Mandy asked. 
“Well I’m not staying here, that’s for sure.” Becky said. The sound of a car approaching turned their attention. <br>
“Yes!” Becky wailed. “See?” she looked at Mandy. The car got closer towards them. It was a cop car. The tyres came to a halt. The window rolled down as an officer’s face came into view. <br>
“You girls having some trouble?” he asked them. <br>
“No…actually…” Mandy was cut off. “Yes…yes we are. Our car broke down and I was wondering If we could get a ride to the nearest town maybe, or maybe to a garage nearby…?” Becky asked the officer. <br>
He chuckled. “Ladies, the next town has a garage but it’s pretty far away, trust me.” He replied. Becky sighed. <br>
“How about this? You two can come to my house which is nearby where you can spend the night and we’ll see what we can do tomorrow about your car…” he said. <br>
“No thanks officer but…” Mandy was cut off again. <br>
“That would be great if it means no disturbance to you…” Becky said. <br>
“Hey, just helping you two out that’s all. Grab your things and hop in.” He said. <br>
“That sounds great…we are so grateful…” Becky said as she went back to the car. Mandy followed. <br>
“Becky…this isn’t a good idea.” She said. <br>
“It’s a cop. He helps people. Just…shut it and come with me if you want…” Becky said. <br>
“Yeah but why can’t he help us now?” Mandy asked. <br>
“Because the town is far away. You heard him didn’t you?” Becky headed towards the cop car. Mandy sighed and grabbed her things before following her. The car paced ahead slowly.<br>
“My name’s Officer Colton, and what about you two?” He said.<br>
“I’m Becky and that’s Mandy.” Becky said. Colton looked back at Mandy. She glanced back with a weak smile. <br>
“So what are you two doing here?” Colton asked. <br>
“There’s a concert happening in Shrewsbury, so we’re heading there…” Becky said. <br>
“Oh Shrewsbury…that place is far…” Colton said. <br>
“Yeah and getting stuck here made it worse. Hopefully we can get there by tomorrow evening.” Becky said. Mandy just sat in the back seat, listening. <br>
“Yeah…I hope you two get there too.” Colton said. <br>
Mandy looked at a sign ahead. <br>
*Next Town 2 miles* <br>
“Hey the town looks close. It says 2 miles.” Mandy asked Colton. <br>
“Oh no sweetie, we’re turning here, see that old shack up there with the lights? That’d be my home.” Colton said. <br>
“But the town is only 2 miles from here…” Mandy said, nervously. <br>
“Oh what? Munster? That town is dead as a cemetery. No point going there. The one after that is what we’re looking at.” <br>
Colton said as the car made a right turn through a muddy road and towards an old house which had lights on. Becky looked back and smiled at Mandy. Assuring her everything was going to be okay. The car pulled up against the house and Colton got out. <br>
“Home sweet home…you gals make yourselves comfortable. I gotta make a call.” Colton grabbed a phone from his pocket and walked into the distance. <br>
“Come on Mandy” Becky said as she jumped out and walked towards the door. Mandy followed. The house was lit up inside but still looked shabby. Pictures on the wall and newspaper bits lying on the floor. <br>
“Doesn’t this guy ever clean up?” Becky said. <br>
“Look, I don’t feel so good about this Becky, we should go…” Mandy said. <br>
“Go where? We’ll leave in the morning, as he said.” Becky answered. <br>
“Why is he even helping us? I don’t feel at all good about him…” Mandy frowned. <br>
“We’re just going to sleep. Wake up in the morning, and then go fix our car. Okay? Stop thinking too much…” Becky replied.<br>
A loud thud made Mandy wake up and sit on the bed. She wiped the sweat away from her forehead and turned to where Becky was sleeping. She was not there. Mandy stood up from her bed. “Becky?” she asked in a low tone. The bedroom door was wide open. Mandy walked towards it and approached the hallway. “Becky?” she asked again. She kept telling herself everything was okay in her head. <br>
*she probably just went to the bathroom.* <br>
A mumbling sound caught her attention. It was coming from downstairs. “Becky?” Mandy said as she moved towards the basement door. She opened it slowly and walked downstairs. “Becky?” Mandy said again. <br>
“Mandy, don’t worry, Becky is completely fine…” Colton said. <br>
Mandy saw in horror as Becky lay hanging from the ceiling. Naked, mouth shut, cuts on her body. Colton was standing next to her with a kitchen knife. <br>
“Just one of my hobbies…” Colton snickered as he drew the knife closer to Becky’s neck. Her eyes completely filled with tears. Her face pink in colour. “Don’t worry you’ll get your turn, Mandy.” Colton snickered again as he placed the knife slowly against Becky’s throat and slowly pierced it into her soft skin and slit towards the side. <br>
“No! Becky…You sick fuck…!” Mandy grabbed the nearest stool and threw at Colton. The stool smacked him against his arm as he fell to the floor. Mandy in shock sprinted upwards towards the hallway. <br>
“Now Mandy, running ain’t fun is it…?” Colton smiled and followed her. She ran towards the main door only to find it locked. <br>
“Help!” she screamed. “Help! Somebody help me!” She wailed again. <br>
“No one will help you sweetie…stay calm and we can talk…you don’t wanna end up like your friend now do you…?” Colton said. “Stay the fuck away from me…” Mandy demanded. Colton smiled again. Mandy twitched her head backwards and saw the window and ran towards it. She grabbed the nearest chair and with all her strength, wailed it against the window. The window cracked open and as she was about to jump through, Colton grabbed her hair and smashed her head against the window frame. A small piece of glass pierced through her cheek. <br>
“You think you’re gonna get out of here? You really do?” Colton said as he smacked her face against the frame once again. <br>
“Please…please…stop…” Mandy stuttered, her mouth bleeding. <br>
“As long as you listen to me and be a good girl, I will.” Colton said. <br>
“Please…please…” Mandy pleaded again, tears running out of her eyes. <br>
Colton gripped on her hair tighter and proceeded to drag her towards the basement. Mandy forced herself to break free but it was of no use. That’s when she noticed the broken chair leg which broke off when she broke the window. She got hold of it and spooled it behind Colton’s thigh, releasing free. <br>
“Aghh…you bitch..!” Colton shook away quickly and grabbed the leg out of his thigh. By this time Mandy had already made a run for it outside. “Ah...fuck!” Colton limped behind her as fast as he could. <br>
“Help!” Mandy screamed out. <br>
“You fucking bitch…you better not run away…” Colton tried to reach her as he struggled to keep up with her. <br>
“Help! Someone…anyone please help me…!” Mandy let out as she made her way closer towards the road. She tripped over and fell, hitting her head. Distant footsteps could be heard now. Colton had struggled to keep up with her. Mandy shook herself up and slowly made her way to the road. Feeling dizzy, her face covered in blood, with all the cuts. <br>“Someone…someone…help…” before she finished the sentence, a car smashed into her, out of nowhere as she flew ahead of the road and landed face first.<br>
<br>
“Holy shit…Charlie what the fuck did you do…?” one of the guys in the car said. <br>
“Benny…told you to keep the volume down…” Charlie replied. <br>
“What the fuck man…now it’s my fault?” Benny asked. <br>
“What do we do?” Charlie asked. <br>
“We…we need to call 911 man…wait…we should take her with us. We can find the nearest town and see what she needs…” Benny was cut off. <br>
“Benny get in the car.” Charlie said. <br>
“What…why?” Benny was confused. <br>
“Get in the fucking car Benny…” Charlie said as he rushed towards the door. He got in and waited for Benny. Benny followed and got inside. <br>
“What the fuck are you doing Charlie? We need to help her!” Benny said. Charlie started the car. <br>
“We’re leaving Benny…we can’t get involved in this shit!” Charlie said as the car slowly moved ahead.<br> 
“Charlie stop!” Benny exclaimed. <br>
The car smoothly drove past Mandy and bolted ahead.<br><br>
