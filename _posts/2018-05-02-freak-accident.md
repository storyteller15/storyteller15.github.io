“Help me…” Tom stuttered out. He couldn’t get out of the car due to the branch that had pierced into his stomach through the windshield. “Josh…help me…” Tom pleaded. <br>
Josh dragged himself out of the car and looked behind towards his wife who was slowly regaining consciousness. <br>
“Help Jenn first…” Tom said. Josh looked back at Tom. He was struggling. <br>
“AGH…FUCK…Josh hurry…” Tom screamed. <br>
Josh took out his phone first and called for an ambulance before doing anything. He then grabbed a branch and slammed the back window open and grabbed his wife’s feet, trying to pull her out. <br>
“Ugh…” Josh struggled. “Almost there…” He said. Josh had minor injuries only as seen from his body and his wife was still partly unconscious. <br>
“Josh…” Jenn tried to speak. <br>

“Calm down babe, everything will be okay…” He assured her. <br>
“Josh…” Tom was now struggling even harder to move and every time he struggled, more blood gushed out of his belly. <br>
Josh looked back at Tom for a second and looked back at his wife in his arms. <br>
“Josh…help me now…” Tom pleaded. <br>
“No.” Josh said. <br>
“What…” Tom was confused. <br>
Josh grinned back at Tom. <br>
“You think I don’t know?” Josh asked. <br>
“Josh, what are you talking about? I have no idea, please help me…” Tom pleaded again. <br>
Josh grabbed Jenn by her hair and smashed her head against the already broken windshield. A chunk full of glass pierced into her face. <br>
“JOSH! What the fuck are you doing? That’s your wife…” Tom screamed. But even as he screamed, he felt even more pain. <br>
“You know why the car didn’t have any brakes? Cause I removed it…” Josh said as he smashed Jenn’s face against the windshield again. <br>
“What the fuck…” Tom shrugged. <br>
“I know you two have been fucking each other…I had my suspicions until I finally saw her phone…She was dead to me since then…And now she literally is dead to me.” Josh said as he grabbed her face, opened her mouth and pierced the edge of the hood into her mouth, piercing it in two. He then grabbed her body and squeezed it back into the car. Tom’s face became plump red. <br>
“You bastard…we’ve been friends forever…and you do this to me…?” Josh asked. <br>
“Josh…I’m…I’m really sorry…it just happened….” Tom stuttered. <br>
“It doesn’t just happen for months and months Tom…it just doesn’t…” Josh said as he grabbed a broken glass piece and walked towards Tom’s seat. <br>
“Please…Josh…please…” Tom said. Josh just gave him a blank expression and slowly pushed the glass piece into his neck, blood sprouted out. A siren could be heard in distance. He walked back into the car and opened the door and sat inside, acting partly unconscious. An ambulance pops up and a few men race towards the car. <br>
