“Listen kid, you tell us that you did this, and we might believe you, you showed us the things you used for arson because we said we needed evidence, you told us you did it to “save them” and that part we don’t understand.” The officer said. “So why don’t you tell us what that means…” he added. 
“Officer, I lived there…I know what was going on there…and it wasn’t something humane. It was torture. It was sadism. And I tried going against them, I told them that I’ll go to the police and that’s when they locked me up in that dreaded room. Months after months I spent my time there, listening to the suffering of my fellow mates and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I had to end the suffering, whenever I got the chance, my mates brought stuff to me that helped me, that helped them…” the boy said. <br>
The officer shook his head. “So what you’re saying is that your mates were okay with the idea of you burning down the place and killing dozens of innocent people with it?” the officer asked. 
“Yes. Yes they were. They wanted to end the suffering officer, I wanted to as well, but sadly I’m still here…” the boy answered. <br>
The officer walked away from the boy and towards his partner. <br>
“Obviously this is bullshit, what kind of “mates” want to be set on fire?” His partner put forward. 
“True but the evidence, that’s true. He did use them.” The officer said. <br>
“What are you planning to do?” his partner asked. <br>
“I’m gonna take him in. But I’m thinking he’s out of place in his mind, there are a few survivors, I need to ask them too.” The officer said. He walked out of the room and walked further into a different one. There, 3 people lay on beds, body burnt. <br>
“Did he do it?” the officer asked. <br>
“YES!” one of them immediately answered. <br>
“He’s…he’s a psycho…arrest him…” another said. <br>
The 3rd person remained quiet.<br> 
“Calm down…talk to me about what happened.” The officer asked.<br> 
“Ever since we had a fireworks show at the orphanage, he was interested. He was always interested. He slowly fell in love with fires. Making them. Burning things. He burned so much, but we still took care of him, he was a loner, no one talked with him because they were scared of him, and day by day we became scared of him too…he became someone else, a pyromaniac you could say…we locked him up and kept him away for months until he kept pleading to come out…saying he had changed…but that’s when we realized that letting him out was the biggest mistake we had ever made…” <br>
The officer sighed. He walked away from the room and saw his partner. “What about the other survivors?” he asked. <br>
“Their condition isn’t too good, they’re being diagnosed at the hospital.” His partner answered. 
“The kid…he’s a pyro.” The officer told his partner. <br>
“Dammit. I knew whatever he was saying was bullshit anyways.” His partner replied. <br>
“Well…nothing we can do now, take him in.” the officer said. <br>
His partner ordered a few of his fellow officers into the room and soon enough they came out dragging the boy with them. He showed no signs of struggle, he just exchanged a glance back at the officers standing away from him.<br>
